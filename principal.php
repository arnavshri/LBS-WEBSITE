                          Adhayayan Mahavidyalaya, Harda. On this occasion, I wish to congratulate its Ex Principals Mr R. S. Khirwadkar
                          and Dr G.M.A. Ramani, Teaching and Non-Teaching Staff, Ex and Present Students for their commendable
                          achievement. I have great pleasure in conveying my best wishes to all of you.
                  
                          Lal Bahadur Shastri Vyavsayik Adhayayan Mahavidyalaya, Harda has a reputation for attracting the best students
                          in their chosen faculty. It is a matter of great pride that the College has made consistent progress, year on
                          year, in academic and co-curricular activities.
                  
                          Lal Bahadur Shastri Vyavsayik Adhayayan Mahavidyalaya, Harda is known as No.1 college in Harda District and
                          amongst the top 10 colleges of Madhya Pradesh. This is a tribute to its standard of excellence in academics and
                          commitment to quality education.
                  
                          The role played by its management and staff in the overall development of the personality of students which has
                          been enabled by the various co-curricular and cultural activities taking place in the College is also
                          appreciated.
                  
                          Challenges and Opportunities are two sides of the same coin. Modern education, curriculum development and
                          teaching methodologies are the key features of our success. The manager, businessman and the entrepreneur of
                          today needs and many more weapons are there in our Institutionâ€™s armoury.
                  
                          Overall development of the individual is the goal of education and we all have to ensure that there is no stone
                          left unturned to equip the student of today for the challenges of life. This will require tremendous
                          self-motivation on the part of all concerned but will be fulfilling for the student as well as the faculty.
                  
                          The faculty and curriculum of the College has always been a trend setter but what has also been noteworthy is
                          the excellent support and commitment of the non-teaching staff. I wish to congratulate the entire faculty and
                          other staff for encouraging and guiding the students in all aspects of their well rounded development.
                  
                          I wish you all the best for achieving greater success and scaling newer heights in your education and career
                          ahead.
